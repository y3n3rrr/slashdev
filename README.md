# slashdev

Project created with react native v0.68.2. There is 0.69.0 released recently but v68 still considered latest stable version for development.
You will need Nodejs installed in your device to run the application, if you dont have it you can download it via https://nodejs.org/en/. You can download and istall LTS 16.16.0

initial Setup:

1)Open terminal and clone the repo:"git clone https://github.com/y3n3rrr/slashdev"

2. Then we need to install required packages; open terminal and go to root folder run; 'yarn' command

3. Start bundler via command; 'react-native start', Remember you need react-native cli installed in your device to run this command

4. This is environment specific step to run our app so;

- Windows users should start android studio and open project in 'slashdev/android' folder. Then start building to run app in emulator.
  I also assume you have Android studio, Emulator and Java is installed in your device. Check for more information; https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup

- Mac users can start xcode and open project via 'shashdev/ios/shoppingcart.xcworkspace' and start bulding, also in case of pod packages error in your device;
  go to ios folder remove 'build' folder and 'Podfile.lock' and run command 'pod install' and start building

Thats all, hope you have fun as I have building this assesment app.
